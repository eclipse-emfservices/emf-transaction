		<p>
			As a second part of the transaction framework there is a support layer for using the <code>TransactionalEditingDomain</code>
			in the context of an eclipse <code>IOperationHistory</code>. This support layer can be found in the <code>org.eclipse.emf.workspace</code>
			plugin and has the following main classes that can be used by clients:
			<ol>
				<li>
					The <code>WorkspaceEditingDomainFactory</code> can be used to create a new transactional editing domain
					that delegates it command execution, undo and redo to an <code>IOperationHistory</code> that is either provided
					by the client or retrieved from the <code>OperationHistoryFactory</code>. Any EMF-style commands executed
					on this special transactional editing domain's command stack will be wrapped and executed on the operation history.
				</li>
				<li>
					All <code>IOperation</code>s that will be making changes to a workspace transactional editing domain
					can subclass the <code>AbstractEMFOperation</code> class in order to obtain the necessary write lock.
					Note that undo and redo is handled automatically because the changes made during the operation's execution
					are recorded. The <code>CompositeEMFOperation</code> allows clients to compose operations that change
					their editing domain and those that make changes to non-EMF objects. Client must not
					make changes to non-EMF objects within an AbstractEMFOperation because undo/redo is expected to
					be handled automatically by recording changes to EMF objects.
				</li>
				<li>
					Clients can determine if an operation affects their EMF resource(s) by
					calling <code>ResourceUndoContext.getAffectedResources()</code>. This is particularly useful for
					<code>IOperationHistoryListener</code>s to determine whether or not a completed operation
					should be tagged with their own <code>IUndoContext</code> to signal that this operation should
					show up on their undo/redo menus.
				</li>
				<li>
					A <code>WorkspaceSynchronizer</code> is provided to help clients keep their editing domains
					synchronized with changes that are being made to files in the eclipse workspace.
				</li>
			</ol>
