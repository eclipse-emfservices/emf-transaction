/**
 * Implementation of a lock.  The lock is recursive; it can be
 * {@link #acquire(boolean) acquired} any number of times by the same thread,
 * but it records how many times it was acquired (its {@link #getDepth() depth}).
 * It must be {@link #release() released} as many times as it was acquired.
 * <p>
 * If there is a possibility that the thread attempting to acquire a lock may
 * be the Eclipse UI thread, then it is advisable to use the
 * {@link #uiSafeAcquire(boolean)} method to acquire the lock.  This method
 * uses the Eclipse Jobs API to ensure that the UI thread maintains the
 * liveness of the event loop and shows the "Blocked" dialog when necessary to
 * inform the user of what other activities in the resource that it is waiting
 * for.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A lock may be acquired for exclusive or non-exclusive access to the resource
 * that it is protecting.  Any thread that holds the lock non-exclusively can
 * {@link #yield() yield} it to other threads that are waiting for it as long
 * as those threads are trying to acquire it for non-exclusive access.  If the
 * <code>yield</code> returns <code>true</code>, then the thread must release
 * it (to whatever depth it currently holds it) so that others may acquire it.
 * While the lock is being yielded, it cannot be acquired for exclusive access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This lock implementation ensures fairness of awakening threads waiting to
 * acquire it by enqueuing them in FIFO fashion.  In addition, if a thread
 * times out of a timed <code>acquire</code> call, it maintains its position in
 * the queue if it re-attempts the acquire before it is dequeued.  This helps
 * threads that need to time out regularly (e.g., to check for progress monitor
 * cancellation) to still benefit from the fairness of the scheduling strategy.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The interaction of threads with <code>Lock</code> instances can be debugged
 * by enabling the <code>org.eclipse.emf.transaction/debug/locking</code>
 * trace option.
 * </p>
