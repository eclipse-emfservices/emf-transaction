Implementation of the transactional editing domain API.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This package provides the default implementation of the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.transaction.TransactionalEditingDomain} and related interfaces.
It also defines a number of "internal" interfaces that implementations of
the corresponding public interfaces must also implement in order to function
correctly together.  The intent is that clients extending the EMF Transaction API
need only to implement these interfaces in order to "plug in" their custom
implementation classes, rather than extend the *Impl classes defined in this
package.
<p>
<b>Note</b> that the types in this package are intended only for use by
clients extending the EMF Transaction API.  Clients using it should only
use the API defined by the {@link org.eclipse.emf.transaction} package.
