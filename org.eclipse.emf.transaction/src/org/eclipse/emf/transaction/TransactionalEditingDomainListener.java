/**
 * <p>
 * A listener interface providing notifications of changes to a transactional
 * editing domain. This differs from the {@link ResourceSetListener} which
 * notifies of changes to the resource-set managed by the editing domain. The
 * events that occur in a transactional editing domain are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>pre-notification of the
 * {@linkplain #transactionStarting(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent) starting}
 * of a top-level transaction</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #transactionStarted(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent)
 * successful start} of a top-level transaction</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #transactionInterrupted(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent)
 * interrupted start} of a top-level transaction (thus a non-start)</li>
 * <li>pre-notification of the
 * {@linkplain #transactionClosing(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent) closing} of
 * a top-level transaction</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #transactionClosed(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent)
 * successful or failed close} of a top-level transaction</li>
 * <li>{@linkplain #editingDomainDisposing(TransactionalEditingDomainEvent)
 * disposal} of the editing domain</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The {@link TransactionalEditingDomainListenerImpl} class provides convenient
 * empty implementations of the listener methods, suitable for subclassing to
 * selectively implement these call-backs.
