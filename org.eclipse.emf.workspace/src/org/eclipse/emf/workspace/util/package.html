Utilities used by/with the workbench editing domain API.

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

This package provides some utility classes used by the EMF Transaction Workbench
Integration API, which would also benefit clients extending that API.
<p>
Of particular interest to clients is the
{@link org.eclipse.emf.workspace.util.WorkspaceSynchronizer} class, which
provides a facility for synchronizing in-memory EMF resources with the state
of the workspace files in which they are persisted.
</p>

@see org.eclipse.emf.workspace
