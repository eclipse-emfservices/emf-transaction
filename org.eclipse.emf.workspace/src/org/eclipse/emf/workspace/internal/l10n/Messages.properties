# ==============================================================================
# Translation Instruction: section to be translated
#
# Problems in execution of operations on the operation history.
# ==============================================================================

# Indicates that the thread executing a command was interrupted.
executeInterrupted=Execution of operation interrupted while waiting for read/write transaction

# Indicates that the transaction in which an operation executed was rolled back.
executeRolledBack=Execution of operation was rolled back (probably due to validation errors)

# Indicates that the thread undoing a command was interrupted.
undoInterrupted=Undo of operation interrupted while waiting for read/write transaction

# Indicates that the transaction in which an operation was undone was rolled back.
undoRolledBack=Undo of operation was rolled back (possibly due to concurrent write)

# Indicates that the thread redoing a command was interrupted.
redoInterrupted=Execution of operation interrupted while waiting for read/write transaction

# Indicates that the transaction in which an operation was redone was rolled back.
redoRolledBack=Redo of operation was rolled back (possibly due to concurrent write)

# Indicates that a run-time exception occurred in the execution of an exception
#   handler by the command stack
exceptionHandlerFailed=Uncaught exception in command stack exception handler

# Indicates that the recovery of a failed undo also failed
#   args:
#     0 - reason for the failure.  This is either an exception message
#         or the 'cannotRedo' message, below
undoRecoveryFailed=Recovery of failure to undo an operation failed: {0}

# Indicates that recovery of a failed undo failed because an operation could not redo
cannotRedo=Cannot redo the operation that was undone

# Indicates that the recovery of a failed redo also failed
#   args:
#     0 - reason for the failure.  This is either an exception message
#         or the 'cannotUndo' message, below
redoRecoveryFailed=Recovery of failure to redo an operation failed: {0}

# Indicates that recovery of a failed redo failed because an operation could not undo
cannotUndo=Cannot undo the operation that was redone

# Indicates that the rollback of a non-EMF change in a composite operation involving
# EMF changes failed.
#   args:
#     0 - the label of the operation that failed to roll back
rollbackFailed=Failed to roll back a non-EMF operation "{0}" during rollback of composite operation

# Indicates that a fatal exception occurred in invocation of pre-commit listeners
#   or execution of trigger commands.  The exception is included in the log
precommitFailed=Uncaught exception during pre-commit trigger processing

#
# Patterns for operation labels.
# ==============================================================================

# Pattern for the label of an operation derived from an EMF SetCommand.
#   args:
#     0 - the display name of the structural feature
setLabel=Set {0}

# Pattern for the label of an operation derived from an EMF AddCommand.
#   args:
#     0 - the display name of the structural feature
addLabel=Add to {0}

# Pattern for the label of an operation derived from an EMF RemoveCommand.
#   args:
#     0 - the display name of the structural feature
removeLabel=Remove from {0}

# Pattern for the label of an operation derived from an EMF MoveCommand.
#   args:
#     0 - the display name of the structural feature
moveLabel=Move within {0}

# Pattern for the label of an operation derived from an EMF ReplaceCommand.
#   args:
#     0 - the display name of the structural feature
replaceLabel=Replace in {0}
